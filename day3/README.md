# Day 3

I struggled with this one because I initially mixed up set intersection with set difference and set union.

The example input now has its' own file.

Experimenting with color-eyre for error reporting.
I will eventually stop doing that in future problems and rely on panics since the extra effort hasn't paid off for problems this small.
