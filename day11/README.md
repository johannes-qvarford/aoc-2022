# Day 11

I noticed that the input was almost YAML, so I nudged it a bit and traversed it.
It was a pretty simple solution I think.

I intially replicated intermidiary output in the aoc example and then removed the print statements.
This allowed me to build up the problem more incrementally.

I didn't focus much on domain modeling this time, but it worked out fine in the end.
