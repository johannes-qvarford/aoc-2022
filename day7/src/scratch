i need to keep a stack of directory names.
whenever i encounter content, i need to find the subtree and add to it.
therefor, a directory can contain a vec of nodes, that are discovered one at a time and added to the tree.
each Tree refers to it's parents at construction
cd .. sets the current tree to the parent of the current tree.
cd x creates a new Tree that sets its' parent to the current tree.
Each tree knows its name on construction.
but we will just be shaving this tree until we get to the bottom, the intermediary trees are gone.

instead of a tree, let's just use a dictionary, and add an entry at each ls.
let's keep a stack so we can pop it when doing "cd ..".
then we do a depth first search, replacing directory names, with actual sizes.
