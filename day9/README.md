# Day 9

I liked this one a lot. I originally built the snake as a head+tail, but it generalized nicely to a list of snake segments in part 2.

Getting the segments to follow each other correctly was the hard part.

I've really started to appreciate taking some time to build visualization functions to debug issues with the solution.
